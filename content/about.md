In 2022, I received my PhD in the field of Computational Biology at Cornell
University, where I worked in the [Clark Lab](http://blogs.cornell.edu/clarklabblog/) and [Messer Lab](https://messerlab.org). Before coming to Cornell, I was at the
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, where I earned a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in
Genetics.

In my research, I am an evolutionary biologist specialized in the theory and application of population genetics. I am interested in really fast adaptation by natural selection, the kind that can happen in a few generations. This type of adaptation is the driving force behind pests becoming resistant to pesticides, pathogens becoming resistant to drugs, and the potential recovery of populations on the verge of extinction.

As a computational biologist, I create methods to make inferences from genomic
data using mathematical modeling, statistics, machine learning, simulation, and
data visualization.
