Before coming to Cornell, I was at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, where I earned a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Genetics.
In my research, I am an evolutionary biologist specialized in the theory and application of population genetics. I am interested in really fast adaptation by natural selection, the kind that can happen in a few generations.</description></item></channel></rss>
